I don't believe these permissions are out of scope for these extensions as they need to work flawlessly and correctly.

I have checked reviews for each etension and all these are legitimate extensions that are made for simplifying and enhancing my work.
There is no shady or suspicious extension in my browser.

The unused one would be VideoDownload Helper as i don't download videos much from the internet.

After removing the extension and restarting the browser i did not see any visual improvement for the browser or my device.
I also checked witht the task manager and the browser has similar percventage of cpu and the memory being used.



Malicious extensions can harm users by logging he information they can access in the browser and sell it to data brokers which may then accelerate 
to being sold on the dark web or to advertising companies for pop up ads.
if the extension can have a permission that lets someone else remotely log in to your device and the user does not check for that permission and installs
the extension anyway, it can give away control of the device to the malicious agent.
f an extension is allowed to access all the web pages that the user visits, the user could be opening the door to malicious attacks. 
It could function as a keylogger and capture sensitive information, insert advertisements, 
redirect the search traffic to malicious sites, etc.
